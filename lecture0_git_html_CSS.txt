                            //Version Control with git//

git is used to keep track of every version you write.
It's used to sync code from different people
Good to test a new version without breaking the previous working Version
you can revert back to a previous version very easily

git push // pushes the file to the remote github server
git pull // downloads the latest version from github to the local memory
github pages to publish a repository


                            // HTML //
useful tags
title
<ul> </ul>
<ol> </ol>
<img src="cat.jpg">     // attributes height="200" and width="300" to set size
                        of image; if only one is specified the other will be
                        adjusted automatically. Size can be specified as %

<table>                 //starts the table
    <tr>                //starts a row
        <th>            //table header
        <td>            //table data

<from>
    <input>             // needs a type, name, placeholder etc.
    <button>            // needs a submit method, route etc.

<div>                   // is a divider in a page can be used for multiple
                        things. can get an id, which is a unique identifier.
<span>                  //can be inside a div and given a class="name" which
                        doesn't have to be unique


                            // CSS //
Cascading Style Sheet
CSS is used to further style a website

<style>                 // inside the style text you can define the style via
                        CSS. This keeps HTML and CSS separated. However with
                        more html pages it is better to outsource CSS into
                        a completely different file.
                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="file_name">

<style>
    div {
        background-color: teal;
        width: 100px;
        height: 200px;
        margin: 30px                                    // like a invisible border outside
        padding: 20px;                                  // inside padding with a invisible border
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif                  //two fonts if browser doesn't have first
        font-size: 28px;
        font-weight: bold;
        border: 3px solid blue;
    }

#bottom         // to style an element id which name is bottom
.name           // to style a CSS class which name is name
