                            //Version Control with git//

git is used to keep track of every version you write.
It's used to sync code from different people
Good to test a new version without breaking the previous working Version
you can revert back to a previous version very easily
github is a website to save git-repositories
git clone (URL) gets a file from the repository found in the URL
git add <file> git tracks this file and remembers any changes
git commit
git status
git push // pushes the file to the remote github server
git pull // downloads the latest version from github to the local memory
